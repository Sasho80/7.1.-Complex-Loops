01.Example: Numbers 1...N with Step 3
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to n with step of 3. For example, if n = 100, the result 
will be: 1, 4, 7, 10, …, 94, 97, 100.

02.Example: Numbers N...1 in Reverse Order
Write a program that prints the numbers from n to 1 in reverse order (step of -1). For example, if n = 
100, the result will be: 100, 99, 98, …, 3, 2, 1.

Hints and Guidelines
We can solve the problem in the following way:
• We read the number n from the console input.
• We create a for loop by assigning int i = n.
• We reverse the condition of the loop: i >= 1.
• We define the size of the step: -1.
• In the body of the loop, we print the value of the current step.

03.Example: Numbers from 1 to 2^n with a For Loop
In the following example, we will look at using the usual step with size of 1, combined with a calculation 
at each loop iteration.
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 2^n (two in power of n). For example, if n = 10, 
the result will be: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024.
